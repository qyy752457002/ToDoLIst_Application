By default, HTML forms only support GET and POST methods

1. <form action="/" method="post">: 
    This form uses the POST method to submit data to the server. It's commonly used for actions that modify data on the server, such as creating or updating records.

2. <form action="/" method="get">:
    This form uses the GET method to submit data to the server. 
    It's typically used for actions that retrieve data from the server and should not cause any modifications to the server's data. 
    GET requests are also the default method for HTML forms if you don't specify the method attribute.

For other HTTP methods like DELETE, PUT, PATCH, etc., you can use workarounds like the "_method" input field and middleware libraries like "method-override" to simulate these methods with POST requests. 
This is a common practice in web applications when you need to perform actions other than basic GET and POST operations.
